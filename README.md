This is my submission for the Udacity Data Analysis intro course as part of the Data Analysis Nanodegree

The aim of the project was merely to take a look at some data in Python, do some cleaning and present one or two findings.

The data is around hospital appointments in Brazil and is based on whether people turned up for the appointment or not ("no shows"). The raw data is in the csv with the main analysis in the jupyter notebook
